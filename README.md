# 15 puzzle++
This a a project which reflects my python-learning process.It uses a python model called pygame.
The project is my first accomplishment updated in github.I hope it can be a record in the road of my code learning.

Notice:
    This project must be based on python and you need to install pygame before you run it.Ways to install can be learnd from google or other search engine.
    Open file named"slide_puzzle.py" and run it,then you can enter the game interface and start.
    Some skills to complete the game refers to some blogs and books,but unfortunately i forget their names,hahaha.So i want to thank them here. 
    So limited knowledge i learn that i can't write beautiful and simple code.I will improve it later.


Hopefully, if you pass by the project and be a little interested in it, please leave your advice or subscribe Pull requests so that i can make it better.They will be treasures in my learning road.
